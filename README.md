**SOMEONE PLEASE FIX ME**. 
I can Control steering via Sending Parking Assist Messages providing a substaintial increase in torque over KLAS messages.
This will be very useful with the comma 3 thats coming out.
I work only when engaged from zero and only steer SPAS up to 6MPH.
Please test with caution and Fix me, send any improvements to johnpr#5623 on discord.
Thank You!!
